# Phoenix with WebSockets

Just messing around with Phoenix and WebSockets.

To start the app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create` and / or `mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
